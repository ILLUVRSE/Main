Bulk local import snapshot for kernel on branch: ${branch}
This branch contains local debug changes and a set of new tests/migrations.
Do NOT merge to main until per-file review is completed.
Files of interest (examples): kernel/sql/migrations/*, kernel/test/*, scripts/*
I will follow with per-file commits or the reviewer can request breaks.
