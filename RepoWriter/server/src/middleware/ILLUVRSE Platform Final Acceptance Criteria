Below is a **complete, no-fluff “100% Completion” criteria** file for the ILLUVRSE Platform.  Put this file in the repo as `ILLUVRSE/Main/FINAL_COMPLETION_CRITERIA.md` (or wherever you prefer). It defines exactly what “done” looks like for the whole platform — module by module, cross-cutting requirements (security, audit, SLOs), testing and governance, and the final end-to-end acceptance.

I kept it strict and measurable: every clause is a pass/fail criterion, and final approval requires the named owners to sign off.

# ILLUVRSE — Final Completion Criteria

**Purpose.** This document defines the criteria for **100% completion** of the ILLUVRSE platform. “100%” means: the feature, module and system-level contracts, security, observability, tests, and governance are implemented, verified, documented, deployed (to the target environment), and signed off by the required stakeholders.

**Scope.** All core modules under `ILLUVRSE/Main/` (Kernel, Agent Manager, Memory Layer, Reasoning Graph, Eval Engine, SentinelNet, Marketplace, Finance, AI Infra, Capital, Product & Development, Market & Media) and platform-wide cross-cutting concerns (signing, audit, policy, infra, CI/CD). See repo overview for modules and responsibilities. 

---

## How to read this file

Each section gives a concise, testable set of acceptance checks. A module is **complete** when **all** its checks pass and the module’s `acceptance-criteria.md` is signed by the final approver(s). The platform is **100% complete** when *every* module is complete and all system-level checks below are satisfied.

Final approver for Core modules: **Ryan (SuperAdmin)** unless otherwise noted; other modules list required reviewers in their README. 

---

## Kernel — Minimum completion (must be 100% done)

Kernel is the single source of truth for orchestration, signing, audit and governance. Complete when:

* [ ] **OpenAPI + server**: `openapi.yaml` exists and is implemented by a production-ready Kernel API gateway. Endpoints (at minimum): `POST /kernel/sign`, `POST /kernel/agent`, `POST /kernel/allocate`, `POST /kernel/division`, `GET /kernel/audit/{id}`, `GET /kernel/reason/{node}` are implemented and pass contract tests. 
* [ ] **RBAC & Auth**: OIDC/SSO for humans and mTLS for service-to-service enforced on all endpoints; SuperAdmin role implemented and tested. 
* [ ] **Manifest signing**: KMS/HSM integration with Ed25519 signing; `POST /kernel/sign` issues canonical `ManifestSignature` objects. KMS key rotation and key-use audit documented and tested. 
* [ ] **Audit log**: Kernel emits append-only, chained AuditEvents (prevHash + SHA256 + signature). Audit events are published to Event Bus and archived to S3 with object-lock. End-to-end verification procedure exists and passes.

---

## Capital, Product & MarketMedia — Minimum completion

Each module must implement its spec and acceptance criteria, integrate with Kernel, SentinelNet and Finance, and be auditable.

* Product & Development **must** implement idea pipeline, handoff → Kernel manifest, store evidence in Memory, feed Eval Engine and Reasoning Graph, and require multisig for high-budget handoffs. 
* Capital must implement deal registration, underwriting, allocation + multisig flows and integrate with Finance and SentinelNet. 
* Market & Media must implement asset lifecycle, campaign orchestration, integration with Eval and Finance, and SentinelNet content checks. 

All these modules are complete when their `acceptance-criteria.md` tests pass and required reviewers sign off.

---

## RepoWriter and IDEA (product handoff automation)

These automation pieces are required for a full production workflow:

* [ ] **IDEA service**: The UI + service implements `/product/idea`, scoring, `/product/handoff` that creates a Kernel manifest and stores evidence in Memory. Handoff triggers multisig when required. 
* [ ] **RepoWriter** (automation): A service that commits Kernel-signed manifests / SKUs / deployment templates into GitHub, triggers CI/preview deploys, attaches `manifestSignatureId` and emits an AuditEvent. RepoWriter must *not* behave as the authority to sign; it only commits Kernel-signed content. (See kernel & product handoff specs.) 
* [ ] **CommandPad integration**: CommandPad multisig flow used to approve handoff/production commits; approvals recorded as AuditEvents. Kernel must sign manifests prior to RepoWriter commit or provide a designated signing proof. 

---

## Cross-cutting, non-functional & compliance requirements

These are platform-wide and mandatory:

* [ ] **Audit chain**: every critical action (manifest sign, commit, promotion, allocation, policy decision) emits an AuditEvent on the Event Bus. Events are chained (prevHash), signed, and archived to S3 with object-lock; verification tooling exists to validate the chain. 
* [ ] **Security**: OIDC/SSO for humans; mTLS for services; KMS/HSM for all signing. High-value/multi-party actions require multisig. No private keys in code. 
* [ ] **PII & SentinelNet**: PII detection, legal-hold, and SentinelNet gating for products containing PII. SentinelNet sim/dry-run + canary modes exist.  
* [ ] **Observability & SLOs**: platform SLOs documented (p95 targets, etc.) for Kernel, SentinelNet, Memory, and Eval. All services have metrics, traces, and dashboards. 
* [ ] **Backup & DR**: tested backups and recovery for Postgres, Vector DB and Audit archives. Runbook for rebuild from audit archives exists. 
* [ ] **CI / CD & reproducible builds**: CI pipelines reproduce server and infra artifacts; model training and serving are deterministic enough to produce reproducible builds and signed artifacts. 
* [ ] **Legal & compliance**: Payment PCI handled by Stripe, legal reviews for Marketplace and product launch, export control and geofencing implemented for Marketplace where required. 

---

## Testing matrix (must pass)

For each module and system-level integration:

* Unit tests: **100% of critical logic** covered.
* Integration tests: external dependencies (KMS stubbed) verified.
* End-to-end tests: One or more E2E scenarios exercised:

  1. Product idea → handoff → Kernel manifest signed → RepoWriter commit → CI preview → Marketplace listing → purchase → Finance ledger -> delivery -> audit chain verified.
  2. Agent spawn → write to Memory → Eval scoring → promotion → Resource allocation → Agent Manager apply -> audit & reasoning graph trace.
* Performance tests: SLO verification (p95/p99) for synchronous flows (Kernel sign, SentinelNet check).
* Chaos / disaster tests: backup restore and failure-mode tests for Event Bus, Memory, and Kernel.
* Security tests: pen tests, secrets scanning, key compromise scenario tests.

All tests must run in CI and pass in a staging environment that mirrors production.

---

## Documentation & runbooks (required artifacts)

Every module must ship the following files and they must be accurate:

* `README.md` (module overview).
* `acceptance-criteria.md` (module tests & sign-off checklist).
* `openapi.yaml` or `api.md` (formal API contracts).
* `deployment.md` (infra, high-availability, certs, KMS, canary/rollback).
* `security-governance.md` or equivalent (RBAC, KMS, multisig).
* `audit-log-spec.md` (audit event format and verification).
* `operational-runbook.md` (runbooks & runbook tests).

These files are referenced in multiple module READMEs and are required for sign-off.  

---

## Sign-off matrix (final authority)

* **Security Engineer** — signs off on KMS/HSM, multisig, SentinelNet policy lifecycle, RBAC and key material handling.
* **Finance Lead** — signs off on Finance integrations, ledger proofs, and Marketplace settlement.
* **ML Lead** — signs off on AI Infra reproducibility and model promotion policies.
* **Ryan (SuperAdmin)** — final approver for Core modules and final system acceptance. (All modules list Ryan as final approver unless otherwise noted.) 

**Final system acceptance** requires written sign-off from the above parties and a passing audit verification exercise (see next section).

---

## Final audit verification exercise (must pass)

Before declaring platform 100% complete, perform a supervised audit run:

1. Run the **audit replay test**: select a range of AuditEvents from Event Bus, verify chain (prevHash, SHA256, signature) and that all events are archived and verifiable from S3 object-lock. (Kernel audit + Memory artifact checks.) 
2. Run the **handoff → marketplace end-to-end flow** described above. Verify Kernel signature is present on manifest, RepoWriter commit metadata references the manifestSignatureId, CI preview deploys, Marketplace validates the manifest and Finance posts correct ledger entries.  
3. Run the **policy gating test**: SentinelNet blocks an unsafe action in synchronous check; policyCheck event emitted and logged. 
4. Run **privacy / legal test**: attempt to publish PII-containing product without SentinelNet approval — must be blocked. 

All steps must be independently validated by Security or Audit team and recorded as signed AuditEvents.
