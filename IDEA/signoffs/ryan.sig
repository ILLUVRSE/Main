final_statement: |
  I, Ryan Lueckenotte (SuperAdmin), have reviewed IDEA's package submission,
  validation pipelines, manifest creation and Kernel-signing flows, multisig
  handoff and emergency apply semantics, publish and marketplace handoff,
  audit emission and replay integrations, and the necessary runbooks and CI
  guardrails. I confirm that IDEA meets the required acceptance gates for
  production readiness and provide final approval, subject to any open items
  noted below.
